# Localization Benchmark

`tools/benchmark` replays public datasets through the same two commands a user runs,
odometry plus `quickstart.py --map <map>`, and scores the published `/pcl_pose`
against ground truth.

## What is measured

Every run starts from nothing: no saved pose and no initial pose, so global
initialization has to find the robot. Scores are taken **in the map frame without
any alignment**. The maps are in the ground-truth frame, and aligning the estimate to
the truth first would hide the worst failure: a wrong initialization that is then
tracked consistently. On a Unitree Go2, such runs were 1.8 m off but looked like
0.2 m after alignment.

| column | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| initialized | runs that published a pose |
| wrong init | runs whose first 2 s of poses were more than 1 m from the truth |
| time to first pose | seconds from the start of the replay |
| median / p95 / max xy | horizontal error of the matched poses |
| >1 m | share of poses more than 1 m off (median over runs) |

## Running it

Build lidar_slam_ros2 (for `rko_lio_odometry.launch.py`) and this package, then:

```bash
export JEPLO_ROOT=/data/jeplo                       # Unitree Go2, upside-down MID-360
export KOIDE_ROOT=/data/koide_hard_localization     # handheld MID-360 outdoors
python3 tools/benchmark/run_benchmark.py tools/benchmark/suites/go2_jeplo.yaml --out results/go2
python3 tools/benchmark/run_benchmark.py tools/benchmark/suites/koide_outdoor.yaml --out results/koide
```

Each case runs three times by default (`--repeats`, `--case` to select). The run
directories keep every log, the recorded trajectory (`est.tum`), the startup status
stream, and `score.json`. `summary.md` and `results.json` collect the cases.
`--evaluate-only` re-scores existing runs, and `--quickstart` runs a source checkout
instead of the installed package.

Datasets:

- JEPLO (Unitree Go2): <https://huggingface.co/datasets/ASIG-X/JEPLO>. The suite uses
  `bags_pc2_merged`, `gt` and leave-one-out maps in the motion-capture frame. Ground
  truth covers the 10 m x 4 m capture area. Long_Stairs and Outdoor* only have maps
  built from the same sequence.
- Koide et al., hard localization: the outdoor MID-360 sequences with
  `map_outdoor_hard.ply` / `map_outdoor_kidnap.ply`. The kidnap sequences cover the
  sensor and carry it elsewhere.
